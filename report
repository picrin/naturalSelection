The effect of natural selection on relatedness of populations.

Description

The objective of the project is to research the effect of natural selection on relatedness of individuals in a population by means of computer simulations. Primary measure of relatedness is time, in generations, to the Most Recent Common Ancestor of individuals alive at any given time in the simulation.

In order to accomodate for various mating, migration, breeding, and inheritance schemes, a flexible framework to carry out forward-time population genetics simulations is developed. The framework is then used to run a simulation, with parameters specific to the simulated population, resulting in an ancestry graph of all simulated graph individuals. Produced graph is then processed and analysed using various relatedness metrics.

Research Question

Does natural selection make populations more related?

Progress

As of currently, most of the framweork has been developed and the first simulations have been executed, various mating schemes have been considered, but none has been fully implemented and executed. The method to compute MRCA of a population has been implemented and tested. Other relatedness metrics have not been considered yet.

Plan

I'm planning to spend the rest of my time on the project designing a suit of simulations, which will provide for enough statistical power to confirm or reject my research question. I will have to brush up my statistics to find and apply an appropriate statistical method to do so. I suspect a big challenge will be to find suitable parameters to run the simulations with. Eventually I should consider and implement other relatedness metrics, such as graph centrality, time to Identical Ancestry, etc. While doing this work I will have to ensure that my simulation framework is delivering correct results, which I hope to ensure by unit testing core functionality.
